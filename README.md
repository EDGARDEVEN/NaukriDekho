We have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript for Frontend and PHP and MySQL for Backend.

​ Problem Statement:-  
In today's world, it is very difficult for the daily wage earners to earn and fulfill their basic needs and requirements because many workers are unable to find jobs due to various reasons like lockdown due to Covid, illiteracy, etc. The money paid to daily wage earners is so low that survival is becoming difficult for them day by day. One of the major problem faced by them is that they have very less job opportunities. Daily wage earners in a city face a major problem of  not finding work.   

​ Solution:-  
We have developed an Online Job Portal named NaukriDekho - A Job Portal for Household/Daily Wage Workers: 
● Here, the jobseeker can hunt for any sort of jobs whether it is a part time job, daily wages, or a job for household work.  
● Here, a jobseeker can seek even the simplest type of job.  
● Here, a job provider can post job.
